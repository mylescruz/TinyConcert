# Background
Project was originally assigned in the Fall of 2020 in my CSCI 322 Programming Languages class. <br />
Original Project Objectives:
 - Demonstrate proficiency with a server-side scripting language (python-flask)
 - Demonstrate proficiency with a client-side scripting language (python-Jinja)
 - Demonstrate appropriate data validation choices (server-side vs. client-side)
 
 I decided to go back to the project and revamp it with my new knowledge and skills. This is an ongoing project that I plan on continuing to improve.
